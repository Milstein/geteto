This benchmark comes from:  

http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lorenz/papers/aosd2003lod/

The paper proposes a checker for Java programs that checks the Law
of Demeter.  They propose a class form checker and an object form
checker, and give the aspectJ code for each of them.

In the benchmark in this directory is their code for the object form
checker, with a small modification.   The modification just stores all
the errors in a hash table and prints them out at the exit of main.  The
original code printed out the same error each time it was encountered, leading
to potentially large output files.
