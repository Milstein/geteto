TODO
- Fix the script to import test cases from JUnit
- Fix the script to update the coverage after a new .trc has been generated
- Review the probe mechanism. Writing (updating) trace files is slow, but
it's only an append operation! Review the classes ProbedNode, DefaultProber
and DefaultProberHook.
- Check if the 'newcmdtool', from JaBUTi-Scalability, is of some use.
